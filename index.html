						<a href=""><h4>NIGHTWISH ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF LIVE VERSION OF "THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA"</h4></a>
						<h5>JANUARY 25, 2023</h5>
						<p>Nightwish fans, get ready for an exciting release this Friday! We are thrilled to announce that we will be releasing the live version of "The Phantom of the Opera" recorded at our sold-out Ziggo Dome show in Amsterdam. This performance marks 17 years since we last played this song, and it was an especially memorable moment for us as it was the first time we played it with Floor Jansen singing.</p>

						<h5>DECEMBER 5, 2022</h5>
						<p>The last stage of getting Floor back to full health involves radiation therapy, which has been rescheduled from February to January. And so, as a consequence, we are unable to come to Asia as scheduled. But don’t panic! All of our team are working solidly on making sure we all see you again soon.</p>

						<h5>DECEMBER 2, 2022</h5>
						<p>With nature at the core of our music, we've become World Land Trust's newest Ambassadors.  Our partnership became official in 2020, when we established together with WLT's partner Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda (GESG) a new protected area in Mexico’s Sierra Gorda region. This area, now officially known as the Nightwish Reserve. </p>
